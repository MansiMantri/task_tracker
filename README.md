## üöÄ Overview

This app demonstrates role-based access control (RBAC) for a simple workflow:
- **Submitters** can:
  - Create, view, edit, and delete their own `"pending"` tasks
- **Approvers** can:
  - View all tasks
  - Approve or reject `"pending"` tasks
  - Mark `"approved"` tasks as `"done"`
- Both roles can **filter tasks by status**
- All data (users, tasks) is persisted in localStorage.
- Task data is stored using `localStorage`
- Authentication is implemented using mock `JWT`

## Setup & Run

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
